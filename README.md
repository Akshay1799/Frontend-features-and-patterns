# Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹

I have created this repository to show and store code snippets of React features and patterns.

In this repo, I'll create separate directories/folders to keep all the features and patterns organized. However, there will be some features/patterns that I'll keep together to demonstrate their use cases.

One more thing I want to mention is that I'll solely focus on logic and patterns.  
I'll also create a basic UI, not a polished one, so things look at least decent.
